# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

A web application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from 28×28 grayscale images. Built with TensorFlow and Streamlit, this project offers a simple, interactive interface for real-time digit prediction.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in image classification using the MNIST dataset. It compares traditional feedforward networks with CNNs and integrates a trained CNN into a Streamlit web interface where users can upload handwritten digits and get predictions instantly.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10  
- TensorFlow / Keras – CNN model training  
- NumPy, OpenCV, PIL – Image preprocessing  
- Streamlit – Web interface  
- Matplotlib – Visualization (during training)

## How It Works

1. **Training Phase** (done in Colab):  
   - CNN is trained on the MNIST dataset (28×28 grayscale digits).  
   - Model saved as `cnn_trained_model.keras`.

2. **Inference Phase** (Streamlit app):  
   - User uploads a digit image.  
   - Image is preprocessed: resized, normalized, and inverted.  
   - CNN predicts the digit and displays the result.

## Model Performance

| Model                          | Test Accuracy | Remarks                   |
|--------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Deep Feedforward Neural Net    | ~96%          | Lacks spatial awareness   |
| Convolutional Neural Network   | ~99.14%       | Retains spatial features  |
