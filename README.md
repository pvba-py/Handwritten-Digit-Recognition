# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project implements handwritten digit classification on the MNIST dataset using two deep learning models: a Deep Feed Forward Network (DFFN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.
